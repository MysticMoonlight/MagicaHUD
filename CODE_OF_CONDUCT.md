# Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in our
community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body
size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender
identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status,
nationality, personal appearance, race, caste, color, religion, or sexual identity
and orientation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming,
diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment for our
community include:

* Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other people
* Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences
* Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback
* Accepting responsibility and apologizing to those affected by our mistakes,
  and learning from the experience
* Focusing on what is best not just for us as individuals, but for the
  overall community

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

* The use of sexualized language or imagery, and sexual attention or
  advances of any kind
* Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
* Threats of violence, or violent acts towards others
* Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or email
  address, without their explicit permission (Doxxing)
* Advocating for, or encouraging, any unacceptable forms of behaviour
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a
  professional setting

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Community team members are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

If a community member engages in behavior violating this Code of Conduct, the members of the community team may take any action they deem appropriate. Actions may range from a simple warning to the most drastic: permanent removal from the community, exclusion from any interaction, and loss of all rights in the community.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces (both online and offline), as well as when an individual is officially representing the community in public spaces. Examples of representing our community include using an official e-mail address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event.

This Code of Conduct applies to all projects, repositories and community spaces that are managed by Mystic Moonlight, regardless of whether or not the use of this code is explicitly called out.

## Reporting a Problem

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported to the Mystic Moonlight community team directly on Discord, with Support ticket. If your report concerns a specific community team member or group of community team members, please send your report to a team member that is not part of the report, or a member of the administrative board.

All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly, and all team members are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the reporter of any incident.

## Changes & Feedback

It is likely that this Code of Conduct will need additions, modifications and other improvements. Online culture changes, new views and sensitivities emerge which need to be taken into account. To that end, we reserve the right to update this Code of Conduct at any time, pending feedback from the community when possible.

We always welcome feedback and suggestions. If youâ€™d like to provide either, feel free to open an issue on our GitHub!
